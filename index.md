# About

The University of Maryland Social Data Science Center Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey, in partnership with Facebook (in short form as The Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey or UMD Global CTIS) is a partnership between Facebook and other academic institutions. The survey is available in 56 languages. A representative sample of Facebook users is invited on a daily basis to report on topics including, for example, symptoms, social distancing behavior, vaccine acceptance, mental health issues, and financial constraints. 

Facebook provides weights to reduce nonresponse and coverage bias. Country and region-level statistics are published daily via public API and dashboards, and microdata are available for researchers via data use agreements.  

Over 200k responses are collected daily. After accounting for variance introduced by the survey weights, the effective sample size is still over 100k responses collected daily. Data for the United States is not included in the UMD Global CTIS but is available at [covidcast.cmu.edu](https://delphi.cmu.edu/covidcast/?date=20210308&region=42003)

**Note:** Aggregates for the API, map, and survey results page are shown for **weighted countries only**. Please find the complete list of countries that are weighted by Facebook [here](https://covidmap.umd.edu/FB_Symptom_Survey_Weighted_Country_List.xlsx).  
Microdata files include both weighted and unweighted countries. For more information on how to gain access to the microdata go [here](https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid-19-symptom-survey-request-for-data-access/).
