## Introducing V2 API and W12/W13 aggregates
An optimization for the backend tables of Aggregation API has been tested since last Aug in the result plots. The updated table is versatile to add new indicator and modify existing indicators and is proved to decrease the labor of database maintanence by 80%. We are planning to publicly release the optimized API as V2 API. Using V2 API would not require change in the query URL but change `api` to `apiv2`. Returned JSON will use a slightly different set of keys: `country`,(`region`),`survey_date`,`indicator`,`sample_size`,`pct`,`se`,(`pct_unw`,`se_unw`) where the indicator names would not appear in the returned keys of JSON. Wildcard(*) is temporarily not supported so the URL must contain specified indicator name, country and region if applicable.  To access the V2 API, one sample URL: https://covidmap.umd.edu/apiv2/resources?indicator=covid&type=daily&country=Brazil&daterange=20200501-20220518

Meanwhile, new aggregates for Wave 12 and Wave 13 including vaccine doses and other vaccine and parenting indicators have been released through the V2 API. Please checkout the new indicators in the [vaccine](https://gisumd.github.io/COVID-19-API-Documentation/docs/indicators/indicators_vaccine.html) and [parenting](https://gisumd.github.io/COVID-19-API-Documentation/docs/indicators/indicators_parenting.html) category

## Incorrect Wave 12 data release (Dec 19,2021 - Jan 10, 2022)

Wave 12 of the COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) launched December 19, 2021. However, we noticed some pipeline issues and worked on the fix. All the data product were up-to-date after 01/10/2022. Thus, any collected data of wave 12 between 12/19 and 01/10 should be void and recollected again.

## All notices

| Date                | Notice            |
|:--------------------|:------------------|
|02/21/2022            | As wave 13 launched on Jan 30, 2022, NEW aggregated indicators for wave 12 and 13 are available now! Checkout the new indicators in vaccine and parenting category!|
|12/19/2021            | Wave 12 of the COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) launched December 19, 2021. However, we noticed some pipeline issues and worked on the fix. All the data product were up-to-date after 01/10/2022. Thus, any collected data of wave 12 between 12/19 and 01/10 should be void and recollected again.  |
|12/17/2021            | On Dec 17th, 2021, Data collection was paused for several hours for all countries due to a system update. Be cautious about the lower sample size when using any of the data product on that day.|
|08/17/2021            | New  indicators from questions C13a and C0a are available now. The newly added 6 indicators starting 05/20/2021 can be found in the indicator categories of `behavior`|
|07/20/2021            | New  indicators from questions V18a and V18b are available now. The newly added 24 indicators starting 05/20/2021 can be found in the indicator categories of `vaccine`|
|06/29/2021            | New aggregate indicators for [survey version 11](https://covidmap.umd.edu/document/COVID19_symptom_survey_intl_V11_0607.pdf) are available now. The newly added 63 indicators starting 05/20/2021 can be found in the indicator categories of `symptoms`,`module`, and `vaccine`|
|06/07/2021            | A new version of the survey (V11) was launched on 05/20/2021. This was a major revision of the survey, and we have observed discontinuities in the covid and flu aggregate indicators as a result of these revisions. <br><br>To test the effects of the changes to the survey, 20% of respondents have been receiving the old version of the survey (V10) and 80% have been receiving the new version of the survey (V11) since its launch on 05/20/2021. To enable monitoring of the observed discontinuities in the existing covid and flu aggregate indicators, we added two new aggregate indicators to the API, cli_w11 and ili_w11, which are calculated using the same methodology. These new indicators (cli_w11 and ili_w11) will be calculated using the 80% of respondents receiving V11 while the existing indicators (covid and flu) will be backfilled to be calculated using the 20% of respondents receiving V10. The new and existing indicators will be backfilled to 05/20/2021 and will continue to be reported in this manner until at least 06/17/21. <br><br>There is also a blog post about the wave 10 and wave 11 CLI trend break [here](https://gisumd.github.io/COVID-19-API-Documentation/docs/notice/blog.html).|
| 06/03/2021           | A new version of the survey (V11) was launched on 05/20/2021. This was a major revision of the survey, and as a result of these revisions, we have observed discontinuities in our covid (COVID-like illness) and flu (influenza-like illness) aggregate indicators that are reported in our API. <br/>To test the effects of the changes to the survey, 20% of respondents have been receiving the old version of the survey (V10) and 80% have been receiving the new version of the survey (V11) since its launch on 05/20/2021. To enable monitoring of the observed discontinuities in the existing covid and flu aggregate indicators, we will be adding two new aggregate indicators to the API,which are calculated using the same methodology. These new indicators (cli_w11 and ili_w11) will be calculated using the 80% of respondents receiving V11 while the existing indicators (covid and flu) will be changed to be calculated using only the 20% of respondents receiving V10. The new and existing indicators will be backfilled to 05/20/2021 and will continue to be reported in this manner until at least 06/17/21. <br/>We are continuing analyses of these discontinuities, but in the interim, we encourage users of the aggregate data to re-pull the backfilled “covid” and “flu”indicators when they become available. To be notified when they are ready, please [subscribe](https://listserv.umd.edu/cgi-bin/wa?SUBED1=COVID19-API&A=1) to our survey listserv. We encourage both users of the aggregate data as well as microdata users to use caution for comparing data collected after 05/20/2021 to data collected before 05/20/2021 for other indicators as well. We also encourage microdata users to use data from the 20% of the respondents who have been receiving the old version of the survey (V10) to evaluate the effects of the survey revisions for the survey questions used in their analyses. |
| 05/20/2021           | We have implemented an updated for aggregate indicators in the UMD Open Data API. They are `vaccinated_appointment_or_accept`,  `appointment_or_accept_covid_vaccine`, `accept_covid_vaccine_no_appointment`, `appointment_not_vaccinated`, `vaccine_tried`, `activity_large_event`, `activity_public_transit`, `activity_restaurant_bar`, `activity_shop`, `activity_spent_time`, `activity_work_outside_home` and an update for the Item # for `tested_positive_recent`,`tested_positive_recent`,and `hesitant_sideeffects`. |
| 05/11/2021           | We have implemented an updated for aggregate indicators in the UMD Open Data API. They are `flu_vaccine_thisyr`, `flu_vaccine_lastyr`, and `avoid_contact`. |
| 05/03/2021           | A new version of the survey (V10b) was launched on 04/26/2021. V10b remains the same configuration as V10 and only differs in the backend survey response collection process . Due to a data processing issue in our pipelines, we have found a bug that causes survey responses for this version(V10b) to not be included in the microdata and aggregations provided by the API. Microdata files and aggregates from 4/27/2021 to 5/1/2021 were affected. As of 5/3/2021, we have implemented a hotfix and backfilled the data to include these missing responses. Re-downloading the data will correct any issues with missing responses. |
| 04/29/2021           | We have implemented an updated for aggregate indicators in the UMD Open Data API. They are `pay_test`, `reduce_spending`, `symp_chills`, `symp_sleep_changes`, `testing_rate`, `tested_positive_14d`, `tested_positive_recent`, `symp_fever`, `symp_cough`, `symp_diff_breathing`, `symp_fatigue`, `symp_stuffy_nose`, `symp_aches`, `symp_sore_throat`, `symp_chest_pain`, `symp_nausea`, `symp_eye_pain`, `symp_headache`, `sick_spend_time_7d` ,and `ever_tested`. |
| 04/29/2021           | Recent Update for issue with standard errors and informed_access:<br/>**Issue #1: Non-CLI/ILI standard errors**<br/>***Overview*** <br/>Weighted and unweighted standard errors were switched in our API for the Global COVID-19 Symptom Survey. While implementing the fix, we aligned the weighted standard error definition with that used in the contingency table aggregates and for CLI/ILI. This definition is as follows, where x bar is the weighted mean: ![std_equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sqrt\frac{\sum_i{w_i^2(x_i-\bar{x})^2}}{(\sum_i{w_i})^2}) <br/>***Scope***<br/>This issue affects standard errors previously reported in our [aggregate data API](https://covidmap.umd.edu/api.html) for all indicators except CLI and ILI. It affects both daily and smoothed estimates, even though only weighted estimates are reported for smoothed (i.e., the SEs previously reported for smoothed weighted estimates were unweighted).<br/>This issue *does not* affect individual-level survey responses that are provided to entities who have signed a microdata use agreement. It also does not affect the US data which has been collected and distributed by Carnegie Mellon University.<br/>***Mitigation***<br/>As of April 29, we have released an update to our API that fixes the issue for both historic and future data. Users who have downloaded historic data will need to re-download the data to ensure that they have up-to-date estimates.<br/><br/>**Issue #2: informed_access indicator**<br/>***Overview***<br/>The definition for the `informed_access` indicator was implemented incorrectly. The definition has been revised and now reflects the percentage of respondents who reported being very informed or moderately informed about how to be able to get a COVID-19 vaccine.<br/>***Scope***<br/>This issue affects previously released daily and smoothed estimates for the informed_access indicator for all dates on which the indicator was available (from 2021-03-01 onward).<br/>This issue *does not* affect individual-level survey responses that are provided to entities who have signed a microdata use agreement. It also does not affect the US data which has been collected and distributed by Carnegie Mellon University.<br/>***Mitigation***<br/>As of April 29, we have released an update to our API that fixes the issue for both historic and future data. Users who have downloaded historic data will need to re-download the data to ensure that they have up-to-date estimates. |
| 03/09/2021            | We have changed the naming for all the `hes` and `hesitant` indicators, **except** for the `hesitant_sideeffects` indicator. We have replaced `hes` and `hesitant` with `barrier_reason`. This change was implemented to better describe what the indicators represent. |
| 03/05/2021            | New aggregate indicators for [survey version 10](https://covidmap.umd.edu/document/COVID19_symptom_survey_intl_V10.pdf) are available now. These include indicators for barrier reasons for why respondents don't think they need a COVID-19 vaccine, how informed respondents are about the COVID-19 vaccine, and indicators on vaccine appointment information. Please refer to the survey instrument documentation for more information on the questions used for these indicators.  | 
| 02/06/2021            | New aggregate indicators for survey version 9 are available now. These include indicators for barrier reasons for vaccine acceptance from V5 question in [survey version 9](https://covidmap.umd.edu/document/COVID19_symptom_survey_intl_V9.pdf). The `trust_healthcare` indicator will be discontinued as of 2/14/2021. As of 2/6/2021, the `trust_doctors` indicator is being be populated. Question `V4_2`, which was used for the `trust_healthcare` indicator, has been discontinued in survey version 9. Question `V4_6` replaces question `V4_2` in survey version 9. Question `V4_6` is used in the `trust_doctors` indicator. Please refer to the survey documentation for more information on the question differences.     |
| 01/21/2021           | We have implemented an updated definition for some of the aggregate indicators in the UMD Open Data API. This definition change impacts the following indicators: `mask-wearing`, `financial worry`, `social distancing`, and `vaccine acceptance`. We are implementing this change to make our estimates more directly comparable to those in [Carnegie Mellon University Delphi research group’s COVIDcast API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.html), which uses data from the US version of the COVID-19 Symptom Survey. Find a more detailed description under the release log section [here](https://covidmap.umd.edu/methodology.html).|
| 12/06/2020           | We released an update to our API. Before this update, the definition of COVID-like illness(CLI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) had been inadvertently switched in the API data. We have implemented a fix that corrects both historic and future data. This issue does not affect individual-level survey responses that are provided to entities who have signed a microdata use agreement. It also does not affect the US data which has been collected and distributed by Carnegie Mellon University. US estimates in the UMD and Facebook maps are also unaffected.
