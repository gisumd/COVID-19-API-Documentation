# Citing


We hope this API is useful to different research groups.  
If you use the API and would like to cite it, the following represents a proper citation of the API itself:

> Junchuan Fan, Yao Li, Kathleen Stewart, Anil R. Kommareddy, Andres Garcia, Joe O'Brien,
> Adrianne Bradford, Xiaoyi Deng, Samantha Chiu, Frauke Kreuter, Neta Barkay, Alyssa Bilinski, Brian Kim, 
> Tal Galili, Daniel Haimovich, Sarah LaRocca, Stanley Presser, Katherine Morris, 
> Joshua A Salomon, Elizabeth A. Stuart, Ryan Tibshirani, Tali Alterman Barash, 
> Curtiss Cobb, Andi Gros, Ahmed Isa, Alex Kaess, Faisal Karim, Roee Eliat,
> Ofir Eretz Kedosha, Shelly Matskel, Roee Melamed, Amey Patankar, Irit Rutenberg, Tal Salmona, 
> David Vannette (2020). The University of Maryland Social Data Science Center Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey, in partnership with Facebook. [https://covidmap.umd.edu/api.html](https://covidmap.umd.edu/api.html)

When referring to the survey in text, we prefer the following formats:

- Long form (such as in an introduction or methods description): “The University of Maryland Social Data Science Center Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey, in partnership with Facebook”.
- Short form (used after the long form has been introduced): “The Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey”
- Acronym form: “UMD Global CTIS”

Prior to July 2021, the survey was known as the COVID-19 World Symptom Survey Data API, and some older documentation and publication may still refer to this name. We prefer that new publications and materials refer to the new name.
