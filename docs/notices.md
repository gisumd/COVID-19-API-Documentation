| Date                | Notice            |
|:--------------------|:------------------|
| 4/29/2021           | We have implemented an updated for aggregate indicators in the UMD Open Data API. They are pay_test, reduce_spending, symp_chills, symp_sleep_changes, testing_rate, tested_positive_14d, tested_positive_recent, symp_fever, symp_cough,symp_diff_breathing,symp_fatigue,symp_stuffy_nose,symp_aches,symp_sore_throat,symp_chest_pain,symp_nausea,symp_eye_pain,symp_headache,sick_spend_time_7d,ever_tested. |
| 4/29/2021           | Recent Update for issue with standard errors and informed_access:<br/>**Issue #1: Non-CLI/ILI standard errors**<br/>***Overview*** <br/>Weighted and unweighted standard errors were switched in our API for the Global COVID-19 Symptom Survey. While implementing the fix, we aligned the weighted standard error definition with that used in the contingency table aggregates and for CLI/ILI. This definition is as follows, where x bar is the weighted mean: ![std_equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sqrt\frac{\sum_i{w_i^2(x_i-\bar{x})^2}}{(\sum_i{w_i})^2}) <br/>***Scope***<br/>This issue affects standard errors previously reported in our [aggregate data API](https://covidmap.umd.edu/api.html) for all indicators except CLI and ILI. It affects both daily and smoothed estimates, even though only weighted estimates are reported for smoothed (i.e., the SEs previously reported for smoothed weighted estimates were unweighted).<br/>This issue *does not* affect individual-level survey responses that are provided to entities who have signed a microdata use agreement. It also does not affect the US data which has been collected and distributed by Carnegie Mellon University.<br/>***Mitigation***<br/>As of April 29, we have released an update to our API that fixes the issue for both historic and future data. Users who have downloaded historic data will need to re-download the data to ensure that they have up-to-date estimates.<br/><br/>**Issue #2: informed_access indicator**<br/>***Overview***<br/>The definition for the `informed_access` indicator was implemented incorrectly. The definition has been revised and now reflects the percentage of respondents who reported being very informed or moderately informed about how to be able to get a COVID-19 vaccine.<br/>***Scope***<br/>This issue affects previously released daily and smoothed estimates for the informed_access indicator for all dates on which the indicator was available (from 2021-03-01 onward).<br/>This issue *does not* affect individual-level survey responses that are provided to entities who have signed a microdata use agreement. It also does not affect the US data which has been collected and distributed by Carnegie Mellon University.<br/>***Mitigation***<br/>As of April 29, we have released an update to our API that fixes the issue for both historic and future data. Users who have downloaded historic data will need to re-download the data to ensure that they have up-to-date estimates. |
| 3/9/2021            | We have changed the naming for all the `hes` and `hesitant` indicators, **except** for the `hesitant_sideeffects` indicator. We have replaced `hes` and `hesitant` with `barrier_reason`. This change was implemented to better describe what the indicators represent. |
| 3/5/2021            | New aggregate indicators for [survey version 10](https://covidmap.umd.edu/document/COVID19_symptom_survey_intl_V10.pdf) are available now. These include indicators for barrier reasons for why respondents don't think they need a COVID-19 vaccine, how informed respondents are about the COVID-19 vaccine, and indicators on vaccine appointment information. Please refer to the survey instrument documentation for more information on the questions used for these indicators.  | 
| 2/6/2021            | New aggregate indicators for survey version 9 are available now. These include indicators for barrier reasons for vaccine acceptance from V5 question in [survey version 9](https://covidmap.umd.edu/document/COVID19_symptom_survey_intl_V9.pdf). The `trust_healthcare` indicator will be discontinued as of 2/14/2021. As of 2/6/2021, the `trust_doctors` indicator is being be populated. Question `V4_2`, which was used for the `trust_healthcare` indicator, has been discontinued in survey version 9. Question `V4_6` replaces question `V4_2` in survey version 9. Question `V4_6` is used in the `trust_doctors` indicator. Please refer to the survey documentation for more information on the question differences.     |
| 1/21/2021           | We have implemented an updated definition for some of the aggregate indicators in the UMD Open Data API. This definition change impacts the following indicators: `mask-wearing`, `financial worry`, `social distancing`, and `vaccine acceptance`. We are implementing this change to make our estimates more directly comparable to those in [Carnegie Mellon University Delphi research groupâ€™s COVIDcast API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.html), which uses data from the US version of the COVID-19 Symptom Survey. Find a more detailed description under the release log section [here](https://covidmap.umd.edu/methodology.html).|
| 12/6/2020           | We released an update to our API. Before this update, the definition of COVID-like illness(CLI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) had been inadvertently switched in the API data. We have implemented a fix that corrects both historic and future data. This issue does not affect individual-level survey responses that are provided to entities who have signed a microdata use agreement. It also does not affect the US data which has been collected and distributed by Carnegie Mellon University. US estimates in the UMD and Facebook maps are also unaffected.
