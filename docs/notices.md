| Date                | Notice            |
|:--------------------|:------------------|
| 4/29/2021           | We have implemented an updated for aggregate indicators in the UMD Open Data API. They are pay_test, reduce_spending, symp_chills, symp_sleep_changes, testing_rate, tested_positive_14d, tested_positive_recent, symp_fever, symp_cough,symp_diff_breathing,symp_fatigue,symp_stuffy_nose,symp_aches,symp_sore_throat,symp_chest_pain,symp_nausea,symp_eye_pain,symp_headache,sick_spend_time_7d,ever_tested. |
| 4/29/2021           | We released an update for our API by following changes: 1. We fix the flipped stander error between weight and unweighted indicators; the changes affect all existing indicators. 2. We update the definition for standard error by using [Binomial proportion confidence interval] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Normal_approximation_interval). The new definition affected all indicators except unweighted std of "CLI and ILI". The effective data started in 2020-05-01. 3.We updated the indicators "barrier_reson_dontneed_*" by apply a new equation using "(V6_ & V1!=1) / (any V6_* = 1 & V1 !=1)". The changes started the data since 2021-02-06 and effected all indicators started with "barrier_reson_dontneed_". 4. We fixed the “informed_access” indicator, which will be more accurate to reflect the respondents who informed how to get a COVID vaccine. We have implemented a fix that corrects both historical and future data. |
| 3/9/2021            | We have changed the naming for all the `hes` and `hesitant` indicators, **except** for the `hesitant_sideeffects` indicator. We have replaced `hes` and `hesitant` with `barrier_reason`. This change was implemented to better describe what the indicators represent. |
| 3/5/2021            | New aggregate indicators for [survey version 10](https://covidmap.umd.edu/document/COVID19_symptom_survey_intl_V10.pdf) are available now. These include indicators for barrier reasons for why respondents don't think they need a COVID-19 vaccine, how informed respondents are about the COVID-19 vaccine, and indicators on vaccine appointment information. Please refer to the survey instrument documentation for more information on the questions used for these indicators.  | 
| 2/6/2021            | New aggregate indicators for survey version 9 are available now. These include indicators for barrier reasons for vaccine acceptance from V5 question in [survey version 9](https://covidmap.umd.edu/document/COVID19_symptom_survey_intl_V9.pdf). The `trust_healthcare` indicator will be discontinued as of 2/14/2021. As of 2/6/2021, the `trust_doctors` indicator is being be populated. Question `V4_2`, which was used for the `trust_healthcare` indicator, has been discontinued in survey version 9. Question `V4_6` replaces question `V4_2` in survey version 9. Question `V4_6` is used in the `trust_doctors` indicator. Please refer to the survey documentation for more information on the question differences.     |
| 1/21/2021           | We have implemented an updated definition for some of the aggregate indicators in the UMD Open Data API. This definition change impacts the following indicators: `mask-wearing`, `financial worry`, `social distancing`, and `vaccine acceptance`. We are implementing this change to make our estimates more directly comparable to those in [Carnegie Mellon University Delphi research group’s COVIDcast API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.html), which uses data from the US version of the COVID-19 Symptom Survey. Find a more detailed description under the release log section [here](https://covidmap.umd.edu/methodology.html).|
| 12/6/2020           | We released an update to our API. Before this update, the definition of COVID-like illness(CLI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) had been inadvertently switched in the API data. We have implemented a fix that corrects both historic and future data. This issue does not affect individual-level survey responses that are provided to entities who have signed a microdata use agreement. It also does not affect the US data which has been collected and distributed by Carnegie Mellon University. US estimates in the UMD and Facebook maps are also unaffected.
